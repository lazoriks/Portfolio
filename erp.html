        <p>Enterprise resource planning (ERP) refers to a type of software that organizations use to manage day-to-day business activities such as accounting, procurement, project management, risk management and compliance, and supply chain operations. A complete ERP suite also includes enterprise performance management, software that helps plan, budget, predict, and report on an organization financial results.</p>

        <p> ERP systems tie together a multitude of business processes and enable the flow of data between them. By collecting an organization shared transactional data from multiple sources, ERP systems eliminate data duplication and provide data integrity with a single source of truth.</p>
