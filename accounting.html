            <p>Accounting is the process of recording, classifying and summarizing financial transactions. It provides a clear picture of the financial health of your organization and its performance, which can serve as a catalyst for resource management and strategic growth.</p>
                <p>Payroll is the compensation a business must pay to its employees for a set period or on a given date. It is usually managed by the accounting or human resources department of a company. Small-business payrolls may be handled directly by the owner or an associate.</p>
