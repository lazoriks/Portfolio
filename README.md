Description

This site is designed to provide a list of consulting, information and development services on various platforms. 
        I am a skilled Salesforce Developer with a strong background in software development, specializing in delivering innovative and scalable solutions for various industries, including mushroom production, catering, and motor transport. My experience includes developing and integrating Salesforce applications using Apex, LWC, Flows, and APIs, as well as data migration using VS Code and Data Loader.

I also have a knack for developing web services, working with JSON, and data conversion for diverse platforms. My passion lies in solving complex problems and optimizing business processes through cutting-edge technology. I am committed to continuous learning and growth as a Salesforce/BAF developer, aiming to contribute to the success of both my company and its valued clients.
